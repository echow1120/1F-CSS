      <p> </p><h3> Volunteer </h3>
    <p> Volunteers  are needed to cuddle puppies, be weekend and vacation puppy-sitters, take dogs out for the day, organize and promote fundraisers, publicity, vet visits, appearances, demonstrations, and training classes. If you are interested in volunteering, please contact us. Whatever your special talents or area of expertise are we can use your help!</p><p></p>

      <h3> Become a Puppy Raiser </h3>
      <p> Service dogs are raised by foster families for approximately 18-24 months. During this time they attend obedience classes and work on the list of service dog commands that they will need in advanced training. Puppy raisers also take the pups with them to public settings such as shopping malls, restaurants, traveling, etc. This socialization is critical in raising a working dog that is not bothered by new environments or experiences and takes everything in stride. Once placed, service dogs go everywhere with their "person." Service dogs are not pets and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) allows service dogs access to public venues.

    <section id="donate">
      <h3> Donate </h3>
      <p> Through the generosity of donations, grants, volunteers, and many fundraisers we are able to place the dogs with their partners free of charge. The estimated cost of raising and training a service dog from puppy to adult working dog is $15,000 or more. To a disabled person who wants a chance to do simple everyday tasks we take for granted, or the family with a special needs child struggling with medical bills, an expense of this size is nearly impossible. </p>
